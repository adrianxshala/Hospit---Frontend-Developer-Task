We are excited to see how you approach this challenge! The goal of this task is to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) form for managing users using Next.js. You will interact with an API to fetch, create, update, and delete users.

This task will be broken into 4 main tasks. You are free to choose your own folder structure and styling approach. The key focus is on handling API interactions and managing CRUD operations effectively.

# How to start
You need to create your own repository, the name of your repository should be: name-surname-Hospit-Frontend-Developer-Task

Replace name and surname with you own 

You can copy this project and put it to your repository or create your own next.js app: npx create-next-app@latest

This repository is just an example how the next.js structure should look!

# Caution !
Do not make any changes to this repository this is just an example!

# API Endpoint:
For this task, you will be using the following endpoint to interact with user data:

API Base URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
This API provides mock data, so your implementation can focus on interacting with it.

# Task 1: Create User
Build a form to allow users to input details like name, email, phone, etc.
When the form is submitted, make a POST request to the API to create a new user.
For the purposes of this task, since the JSONPlaceholder API doesn't actually allow creating new users, simulate the creation on the front-end.
Display a success message or confirmation once the user is added.

# Task 2: Read (Fetch) Users
Fetch a list of users from the API using a GET request.
Display the users in a list or table format on the page.
Each user should display at least the name, email, and phone fields.
Ensure that the list of users is updated in real-time after a user is created (from Task 1).

# Task 3: Update (Edit) User
Implement an option (e.g., an edit button) next to each user in the list or table.
When clicked, this should open a form pre-filled with the user's current details.
After editing, send a PUT request to the API to update the user details.
As the JSONPlaceholder API doesn't actually persist changes, simulate this on the front-end.
Ensure the updated user information is reflected in the list of users.

# Task 4: Delete User
Implement a delete button next to each user in the list or table.
When clicked, confirm if the user should be deleted.
Send a DELETE request to the API to remove the user.
Again, since the API does not actually allow deletion, simulate this on the front-end by removing the user from the displayed list.
Ensure the user is removed from the list after successful deletion.

# Final
When you finish your project copy your repository link and send it to our email: jobs@hospit.ch.
If you can't finish all the tasks, feel free to send whatever you did we will evaluate your work.

For any questions about the tasks feel free to contact our developers:
